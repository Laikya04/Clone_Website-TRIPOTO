## Project Structure
### HTML Files: 
Each HTML file serves as a distinct page within your web application. For instance, index.html provides an entry point showcasing featured destinations, while about.html offers background information on the project or team. places.html aggregates all destinations for comprehensive browsing.

### CSS Files: 
styles.css centrally manages the overall visual presentation. By structuring stylesheets, including typography adjustments and color schemes, you maintain design coherence across diverse web pages. Optional normalize.css fosters consistency in rendering across browsers by resetting default styling.

### Images: 
Under the images/ repository, visuals (e.g., delhi.jpg, goa.jpg) visually enrich destination pages. These images provide glimpses into locales, effectively complementing textual descriptions for immersive user engagement.

### Data: 
If incorporating static data, destinations.json within the data/ directory archives essential destination specifics. This JSON file details attractions, logistical insights, and user-generated reviews (if present). Structured data promotes seamless updates and enhances browsing convenience for users seeking tailored travel insights.
